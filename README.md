## WealthWatchAndroidApp
This is a multi-purpose FinTech Android mobile application which includes a lot of tools and utilities such as a Wealth Tracker, Tip Calculator, Compounding Interest Calculator, Market News, and Stock Screener! This project is currently in a very early build stage and I plan to integrate a lot more tools to help people manage their wealth.

### Current Features:
### --------------
#### - An exchange login API with Account Holdings tracking
#### - A stock screener using FinViz to retrieve a list of stocks based on user specified conditions
#### - Overall Market news (Includes Crypto, Technology, Real Estate, Economy, and All sections)
#### - A tip calculator which calculates a tip which can be split between multiple people based on the Bill's total
#### - A compounding interest calculator

### Future Plans:
### --------------
#### - Add more exchanges to track trades/balances via their APIs
#### - Fully functional trading bot for specific strategies (Must be tested in a Paper trading simulation)
#### - More options on the stock screener
#### - Options contract price calculator
#### - Add a subscription tracker/manager
#### - (More soon)...


### Privacy:
### ----------
#### This application currently only supports RobinHood as a investment tracking option. We do not store any login information, we use Robin-Stocks API to login to the exchange and create/store the session token of that login for 24 hours so that you don't have to login every time you restart the application. Read more about Robin-Stocks API here: https://robin-stocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### FAQs:
### --------
#### Is robin-stocks API safe to use?
##### If you search this question on Google, the results will show: "The python package robin-stocks was scanned for known vulnerabilities and missing license, and no issues were found. Thus the package was deemed as safe to use". This API is the most widely used for RobinHood and commonly used to track balances or trade with a trading bot. If you would like to delete previous stored sessions, you may do so in the Privacy > Devices section on the RobinHood mobile app.
